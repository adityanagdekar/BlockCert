\section*{Abstract}
Academic institutions worldwide struggle with issuing and verifying credentials in a secure, efficient, and scalable manner. Traditional systems are centralized, prone to forgery, and require third-party verification agencies. This project introduces a blockchain-based solution where academic certificates are issued, stored, and verified using decentralized technologies. Leveraging Ethereum smart contracts and IPFS, we ensure immutability, transparency, and global accessibility of credentials, implemented using Java-based technologies.

\section*{Introduction}
In the current digital age, verifying academic credentials remains a slow and manual process. Employers often depend on third-party agencies or direct communication with institutions to validate degrees and transcripts. This introduces inefficiencies, security risks, and high costs.

Blockchain, as a decentralized ledger technology, offers a transformative solution. By recording certificate data as immutable transactions and storing certificate files on a distributed file system (IPFS), we can eliminate fraud and allow instant, trustless verification. Java serves as the primary development environment for our backend system, utilizing Spring Boot for REST APIs, Web3j for blockchain integration, and IPFS clients for distributed file storage. The project emphasizes secure multi-role interaction between universities, students, and employers in a trustless academic ecosystem.

\section*{System Architecture}
Below is the architecture of our proposed system:

\section*{Key Features}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Admin uploads certificate PDF, which is hashed and uploaded to IPFS.
  \item The returned CID is recorded on the blockchain using Web3j and a smart contract.
  \item Employers can upload certificates for verification. Hashes are compared with CID on-chain.
  \item Role-based access: Admin (issue), Student (view), Employer (verify).
  \item Optional: Maintain logs and analytics via a local database.
\end{itemize}
